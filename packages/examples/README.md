### examples

This project is here to make it easier to develop, test, and play with the SDK. It serves as a place to write code that consumes the SDK.

The `src/play` folder's contents are git-ignored, any files there will rename only on your file system. Useful if you want to test things out but not mess with git history. 

### How to Run .ts files

Either of these will run files in the src folder
- `./run.js sdk.ts`
- `yarn x sdk.ts`
