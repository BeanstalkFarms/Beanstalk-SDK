## Commands
This library uses TSDX to build and package

To run TSDX, use:

```bash
npm start # or yarn start
```

This builds to `/dist` and runs the project in watch mode so any edits you save inside `src` causes a rebuild to `/dist`.

To do a one-off build, use `npm run build` or `yarn build`.

To run tests, use `npm test` or `yarn test`.

## Configuration

`prettier`, `husky`, and `lint-staged` are set up respectively in `package.json`

### Tests

Jest tests are set up to run with `npm test` or `yarn test`.
