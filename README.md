# BeanstalkSDK

The current version of the Beanstalk SDK is considered an alpha release. The codebase is novel and has not been tested in the "real world" prior to use by Root and Paradox. Use of the Beanstalk SDK could result in loss of funds, whether due to bugs or misuse.

The SDK is dependent on Beanstalk, and therefore inherits all of the risks associated with Beanstalk. The security of Beanstalk is assumed. For an exhaustive list, consult the [Beanstalk whitepaper](https://bean.money/docs/beanstalk.pdf) and [Beanstalk DAO Disclosures](https://docs.bean.money/disclosures).
